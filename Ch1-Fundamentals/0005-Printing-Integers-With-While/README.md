# 0005: Printing Integers with While

- **Category:** Fundamentals, Set I
- **Description:** Prints integers from 2000 to 5280 using a while loop.

```js
let thisInt = 2000;
while (thisInt <= 5280) {
    console.log(thisInt);
    thisInt++;
}
```

```py
this_int = 2000
while this_int <= 5280:
    print(this_int)
    this_int += 1
```

## Steps Taken

### JavaScript Version:
1. **Initialization**: We start with `thisInt` set to 2000.
2. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `thisInt` is less than or equal to 5280.
3. **Printing**: Inside the loop, we print the current value of `thisInt` to the console.
4. **Increment**: After printing, we increment `thisInt` by 1 using `thisInt++`.

### Python Version:
1. **Initialization**: Similar to the JavaScript version, we initialize `this_int` to 2000.
2. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `this_int` is less than or equal to 5280.
3. **Printing**: Inside the loop, we print the current value of `this_int`.
4. **Increment**: After printing, we increment `this_int` by 1 using `this_int += 1`.

Both solutions effectively print integers from 2000 to 5280 using a while loop, and the logic is straightforward and clear in both languages.
