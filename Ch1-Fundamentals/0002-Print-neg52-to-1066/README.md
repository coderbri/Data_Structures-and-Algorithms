# 0002: Print -52 to 1066

- **Category:** Fundamentals, Set I
- **Description:** Prints numbers from -52 to 1066 using a for loop.


```js
for ( let i = -52; i <= 1066; i++ ) {
    console.log(i);
}
```

## Steps Taken
1. **Understanding the Loop**: Imagine you have a list of numbers from -52 to 1066, and you want to go through each number in that list one by one.

2. **Setting Up the Loop**: To do this, we use a special tool called a "for loop." It's like having a machine that automatically goes through each number in the list for us.

3. **Defining the Range**: We tell the loop where to start (at -52) and where to stop (at 1066). It's like telling the machine, "Start counting from -52 and stop when you reach 1066."

4. **Going Through Each Number**: Once the loop starts, it goes through each number in the specified range, one at a time. It's like the machine counting from -52, then -51, then -50, and so on, all the way up to 1066.

5. **Printing the Numbers**: As the loop goes through each number, we ask it to print that number out. It's like the machine displaying each number it counts on a screen for us to see.

6. **Completion**: Once the loop reaches 1066, it stops because that's the end of the specified range.

In simpler terms, the loop is like a machine that automatically counts through a list of numbers for us, and we're just telling it where to start, where to stop, and what to do with each number along the way.
