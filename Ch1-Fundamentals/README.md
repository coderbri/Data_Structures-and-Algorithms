# Fundamentals

| Set |   No.  | Algorithm Name | Explaination |
|:----|:-------|:---------------|:-------------|
|  I  |  0001  | [Setting and Swapping](0001-Setting-and-Swapping/) | Initializes two variables (`myNumber` and `myName`) and swaps their values. |
|  I  |  0002  | [Print -52 to 1066](0002-Print-neg52-to-1066/) | Prints numbers from -52 to 1066 using a `for` loop. |
|  I  |  0003  | [Don’t Worry, Be Happy](0003-Dont-Worry-Be-Happy/) | Uses a `for` loop to call the `beCheerful` function 98 times, which logs "Good morning!". |
|  I  |  0004  | [Multiples of Three – But Not All](0004-Multiples-of-Three-But-Not-All/) | Prints multiples of 3 from -300 to 0, skipping -3 and -6. |
|  I  |  0005  | [Printing Integers with While](0005-Printing-Integers-With-While/) | Prints integers from 2000 to 5280 using a `while` loop. |
|  I  |  0006  | [You Say It’s Your Birthday](0006-You-Say-its-Your-Birthday/) | Checks if the input month and day match a predefined birthday. |
|  I  |  0007  | [Leap Year](0007-Leap-Year/) | Determines if a given year is a leap year based on specified conditions. |
|  I  |  0008  | [Print and Count](0008-Print-and-Count/) | Prints integers divisible by 5 between 512 and 4096 and counts them. |
|  I  |  0009  | [Multiples of Six](0009-Multiples-of-Six/) | Prints multiples of 6 up to 60,000 using a `while` loop. |
|  I  |  0010  | [Counting, The Dojo Way](0010-Counting-The-Dojo-Way/) | Prints numbers from 1 to 100, replacing multiples of 5 with "Coding" and multiples of 10 with "Coding Dojo". |
|  I  |  0011  | [What do you know?](0011-What-do-you-know/) | Logs the value of an incoming parameter to the console. |
|  I  |  0012  | [Whoa, That Sucker's Huge](0012-Whoa-That-Suckers-Huge/) | Calculates and prints the sum of odd integers from -300,000 to 300,000 using a mathematical approach. |
|  I  |  0013  | [Countdown by Fours](0013-Countdown-by-Fours/) | Prints positive numbers starting at 2016, counting down by fours. |
|  I  |  0014  | [Flexible Countdown](0014-Flexible-Counter/) | Prints multiples of a given number from a high number down to a low number. |
|  I  |  0015  | [The Final Countdown](0015-The-Final-Countdown/) | Prints multiples of a given number within a range, excluding a specified value. |
|  II |  0016  | [Countdown](0016-Countdown/) | Generates a countdown array starting from a given number down to 0, inclusive, and returns the resulting array along with its length for two different input values.
|  II |  0017  | [Print and Return](0017-Print-and-Return/) | A function that receives an array with two numbers. Print the first value, and return the second. |
|  II |  0018  | [First Plus Length](0018-First-Plus-Length/) | A function that calculates the sum of the first value in the array and the array's length, while also ensuring the array is not empty and the first value is a number. |
|  II |  0019  | [Values Greater than Second](0019-Values-Greater-than-Second/) | This function prints values that are greater than a the array's (**[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 13]**) second value and returns the count of such values. |
|  II |  0020  | [Values Greater than Second (Generalized)](0020-Values-Greater-than-Second-Generalized/) | Similar to [Algorithm #0019](0019-Values-Greater-than-Second/), this function indentifies values in an array that are greater than its second element, counts them, and prints the count along with the new array containing those values. |
|  II |  0021  | This Length, That Value | ??? |
|  II |  0022  | Fit the First Value | ??? |
|  II |  0023  | Fahrenheit to Celsius | ??? |
|  II |  0024  | Celsius to Fahrenheit | ??? |

| III |  0025  | ??? | ??? |
| III |  00##  | ??? | ??? |
